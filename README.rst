asetniop: Faster typing.. 
========================================

This is a project (forked from plover) to create software to allow for 
faster, more efficient typing, by mainly using the middle row of a 
keyboard (the a,s,d,f,j,k,l and ; keys).  Using this configuration allows 
one to type much more efficiently then using the key mappings used in
QWERTY keyboards.
